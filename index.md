Flavio has joined Epicentre in 2019 to reinforce the Epidemiology and Data Science team. He has a vast experience in outbreak analytics and supports our teams by providing insights into the dynamics of Ebola, Measles, Cholera and COVID-19 outbreaks. He is passionate about reinforcing the links between classic field epidemiology and modern analytic and data-driven approaches. Before he joined Epicentre he was a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he worked on methods to better understand the mechanisms driving Cholera, Diphtheria and Ebola outbreaks and their spatial propagation, in addition to supporting partners in the field through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. He holds a PhD entitled “Spatially Explicit Modelling of Cholera Epidemics” from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland.
