Flavio has joined Epicentre in 2019 where he supports MSF operations by providing epidemiological insights into Ebola, Measles, Cholera, COVID-19 and other outbreaks and through operational research. He is passionate about reinforcing the links between classic field epidemiology and modern analytic and data-driven approaches and coordinates a group of epidemiologists. He leads a number of research projects, such as:
- A multi-site observational study on the effectiveness of [Case-Area Targeted Interventions (CATI)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061206) to rapidly contain cholera outbreaks
- A pilot study on the deployment of cholera rapid diagnostic tests – pilot studies
- A multi-country retrospective analysis of the impact of reactive Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaigns

In addition to his work at Epicentre, Flavio is the chairman of the [Global Task Force for Cholera Controls](https://www.gtfcc.org/)'s Epidemiology Working Group. He previously worked as a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on methods to better understand the mechanisms driving Cholera, Diphtheria and Ebola outbreaks and their spatial propagation, in addition to supporting partners in the field. He holds a PhD entitled "Spatially Explicit Modelling of Cholera Epidemics” from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.
