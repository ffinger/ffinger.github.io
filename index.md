Flavio has joined Epicentre in 2019 where he works on providing insights into the dynamics of Ebola, Measles, Cholera, COVID-19 and other outbreaks. He is the principal investigator of a multi-site observational study on the effectiveness of [Case-Area Targeted Interventions (CATI)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061206) to rapidly contain cholera outbreaks and leads a number of other operational research projects. In addition, he is the chairperson of the [Global Task Force for Cholera Control's](https://www.gtfcc.org/) Epidemiology Working Group. Flavio is passionate about reinforcing the links between classic field epidemiology and modern analytic and data-driven approaches. 
Before he joined Epicentre he worked as a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on methods to better understand the mechanisms driving Cholera, Diphtheria and Ebola outbreaks and their spatial propagation, in addition to supporting partners in the field. He holds a PhD entitled "Spatially Explicit Modelling of Cholera Epidemics” from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.
